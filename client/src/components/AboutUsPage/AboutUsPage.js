            interpreter at La Clinic in Oakland, CA and his ongoing efforts to preserve indigenous Mayan Mam languages and traditions led him to found Desarollo Maya, an indigenous community network to uplift indignous Mayan \n
            Mam voices in Oakland.  He is passionate about increasing access to qualified and trained indigenous interpreters, and through Multilingual Indigenous Interpreters, he seeks to close gaps that currently exist.`

            In 2015 she started her own social enterprise, Fuerza Indigena, to socially and economically uplift Oakland’s indigneous Mam communities. It is through this project that she realized the dire need for trained indigenous interpreters to \n
            serve the needs of the growing indigenous monolingual speakers in the U.S. In 2019, through initial funding from American Friends Service Committee,  Linda launched Multilingual Indigenous Interpreters.`,
